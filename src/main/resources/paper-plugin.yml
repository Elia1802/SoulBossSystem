description: This plugin was written for SoulSMP. I put a lot of effort into it and I hope you really like it.
  I know this plugin changes the entire server, but sometimes a change is important. This plugin
  ensures that you can earn your own bossfight. But since I still need a lot of ideas, feel free
  to write an idea with the command /mobidea an idea.
